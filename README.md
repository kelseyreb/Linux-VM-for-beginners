Linux VM walk through with explanations

First begin by downloading a Virtual Machine Manager. If you have Windows 11 Pro you could download HyperVisor and create a Virtual Machine that way OR you can download one off the internet. I downloaded one at this website. https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

I then downloaded a debian Net install through this website. –	https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/

This is what your Virtual machine box will first look like when you start it.
